k so this are my thoughts with this project

1. we will make a engine or runtime to train models in distributed way

this are the targets that i need to accomplish

to make a runtime faster than pytorch standards ,

1. load data faster ,
checkpointing, logging , fault tolerant

i am reading a paper called the ATOM , i would take some ideas from there
